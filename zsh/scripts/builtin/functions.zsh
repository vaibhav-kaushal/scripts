# IMPORTANT NOTE: 
# ====================

# 1. Do not use special file names. 
#    The file names (without the .sh extension) need to be valid function and variable names.
#    So, keep it simple: alphanumeric functions with underscores.
#    Do not start the file name with numbers.
#    
# 2. If you want to ignore processing of some files, rename them to func_file.sh to func_file.zsh
