# file). Please check if the variable is already defined
# before setting it unless you want to set it in all your
# sessions.

# To check and set an environment variable named "AUTHOR",
# Follow this method:

# if [[ ! -v AUTHOR ]]; then
# 	# If not defined, set it
# 	export AUTHOR="vaibhav-kaushal"
